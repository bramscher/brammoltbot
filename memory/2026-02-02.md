**Two Campaign Tracks:**
1. **Tenant Campaigns** - Vacancy-focused (Appolio data → carousel images, video slideshows, avatar videos)
2. **Owner Campaigns** - HPDM brand promotion, overlap with existing owner outreach

**Content Flow:**
- Source: Appolio (images, meta data, voice over)
- Processing: Avatar videos (photo + digital twin + std avatar)
- Publishing: Konmashi Scheduler → Konmashi Publisher → Multi-platform (Pinterest, X, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube)

**Also feeds:**
- YouTube long-form upkeep media
- Video shorts
- Blog entries featuring videos
- AI avatars for reception, leasing, marketing

2. **Sally** - Receptionist  
3. **Leesa** - Leasing
