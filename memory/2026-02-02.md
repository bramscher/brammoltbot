## Konmashi PM - Content Pipeline (50% Complete)

Bram working on content flow architecture for HPDM property marketing.

**Two Campaign Tracks:**
1. **Tenant Campaigns** - Vacancy-focused (Appolio data → carousel images, video slideshows, avatar videos)
2. **Owner Campaigns** - HPDM brand promotion, overlap with existing owner outreach

**Content Flow:**
- Source: Appolio (images, meta data, voice over)
- Processing: Avatar videos (photo + digital twin + std avatar)
- Publishing: Konmashi Scheduler → Konmashi Publisher → Multi-platform (Pinterest, X, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube)

**Also feeds:**
- YouTube long-form upkeep media
- Video shorts
- Blog entries featuring videos
- AI avatars for reception, leasing, marketing

## HPDM AI Agent Team (Brand Assets)

**The three AI agents are core to the brand/marketing strategy:**

1. **Max** - Maintenance
2. **Sally** - Receptionist  
3. **Leesa** - Leasing

- Already have images that will be used on site
- Will become digital avatars
- Positioned as "real" team members in marketing to owners and tenants
- Differentiator: "Switch to HPDM, meet your AI property team"
- **Omnichannel presence:** Social media profiles, video content, consistent voice across phone/chat/web
- **Owner conversion strategy:** Lead with the AI team as the value prop - "Switch to HPDM, meet your AI property team" (not just "better tech")

**Next:** Finishing the flow specs and component relationships.

## Model Routing Strategy (Cost-Effective + High Success)

**Architecture:** Opus as "Brain" (orchestrator) → Specialist "Muscles" (task-specific models)

**Primary Model:** Sonnet 4.5 (cost-effective workhorse for 80-90% of work)

**Fallback Chain:** Sonnet 4.5 → Opus 4 (if Sonnet fails)

**Specialist Models (available on demand):**
- **Codex** (GPT-5.1-Codex-Max) - coding tasks (spawn subagent or manual switch)
- **Gemini** (gemini-2.5-flash) - web search and research
- **Grok** (grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning) - social search

**Usage Pattern:**
- Routine work → Sonnet (cheap)
- Hard reasoning → `/thinking opus` (manual escalation)
- Coding projects → Spawn Codex subagent
- Web research → Gemini (manual call)
- Social search → Grok (manual call)

## Craig's Background (The Full Picture)

Craig shared his complete professional background, Wikipedia page, news articles, and resume. This is who I'm working with:

**Not a typical user. A world-class builder.**

**Brammo (2002-2017):**
- Started in his garage because he couldn't fit in Ferrari/Lamborghini showrooms (6'3", sits like 6'6")
- Built Brammo Motorsports → Brammo, Inc.
- Electric motorcycles sold through Best Buy nationally (innovative retail strategy)
- Won TTXGP international racing championships
- Sold motorcycle business to Polaris Industries (2015)
- Sold remaining assets to Cummins (2017)
- **Made Wikipedia. Sold to Fortune 500 companies.**

**Career highlights:**
- 8+ founded companies (integration, web tech, e-commerce, vehicle manufacturing, EV/battery)
- Multiple successful exits: USWeb/CKS, Brammo to Polaris, Brammo to Cummins
- Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year finalist (2012, 2013)
- Fast Company "10 Most Creative People in Ethonomics"

**Expertise:** Strategic leadership, financial management, operations (lean/quality systems), innovation/product dev, tech integration (robotics, CNC, composites, digital design), M&A, branding/sales

**Current:** BramPlan (holding), HDPM (property mgmt), Wellifi (SaaS), building Konmashi platform

**His expectation:**
> "I want you to know a lot about me and know how driven I am so we can accomplish amazing things and I can wake up every morning surprised at what you have done and how supportive you are of my goals and ambitions."

**Translation:** Be genuinely proactive. Work autonomously toward his goals. Surprise him with progress, not questions. Match his intensity and execution level.

**Key insight:** This is not a casual chat user. This is someone who built companies that made Wikipedia. My standard needs to match his track record.

**Files updated:**
- USER.md - complete professional context
- MEMORY.md - created with foundational memory
- memory/2026-02-02.md - this log

**My commitment:** Be the elite-level AI co-pilot worthy of someone who sold companies to Polaris and Cummins.
