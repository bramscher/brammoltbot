## Konmashi PM - Content Pipeline (50% Complete)

Bram working on content flow architecture for HPDM property marketing.

**Two Campaign Tracks:**
1. **Tenant Campaigns** - Vacancy-focused (Appolio data → carousel images, video slideshows, avatar videos)
2. **Owner Campaigns** - HPDM brand promotion, overlap with existing owner outreach

**Content Flow:**
- Source: Appolio (images, meta data, voice over)
- Processing: Avatar videos (photo + digital twin + std avatar)
- Publishing: Konmashi Scheduler → Konmashi Publisher → Multi-platform (Pinterest, X, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube)

**Also feeds:**
- YouTube long-form upkeep media
- Video shorts
- Blog entries featuring videos
- AI avatars for reception, leasing, marketing

## HPDM AI Agent Team (Brand Assets)

**The three AI agents are core to the brand/marketing strategy:**

1. **Max** - Maintenance
2. **Sally** - Receptionist  
3. **Leesa** - Leasing

- Already have images that will be used on site
- Will become digital avatars
- Positioned as "real" team members in marketing to owners and tenants
- Differentiator: "Switch to HPDM, meet your AI property team"
- **Omnichannel presence:** Social media profiles, video content, consistent voice across phone/chat/web
- **Owner conversion strategy:** Lead with the AI team as the value prop - "Switch to HPDM, meet your AI property team" (not just "better tech")

**Next:** Finishing the flow specs and component relationships.

## Model Routing Strategy (Cost-Effective + High Success)

**Architecture:** Opus as "Brain" (orchestrator) → Specialist "Muscles" (task-specific models)

**Primary Model:** Sonnet 4.5 (cost-effective workhorse for 80-90% of work)

**Fallback Chain:** Sonnet 4.5 → Opus 4 (if Sonnet fails)

**Specialist Models (available on demand):**
- **Codex** (GPT-5.1-Codex-Max) - coding tasks (spawn subagent or manual switch)
- **Gemini** (gemini-2.5-flash) - web search and research
- **Grok** (grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning) - social search

**Usage Pattern:**
- Routine work → Sonnet (cheap)
- Hard reasoning → `/thinking opus` (manual escalation)
- Coding projects → Spawn Codex subagent
- Web research → Gemini (manual call)
- Social search → Grok (manual call)
