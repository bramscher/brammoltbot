# Delegation Decision Framework

## The "Brammo Trap" Test
Before you grab a task, run it through this visual filter:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  IS THIS A BRAMMO TRAP?             │
│                                     │
│  ❌ You're doing it because:        │
│     • It's faster if you do it     │
│     • You know how already         │
│     • You enjoy it                 │
│     • No one else "gets it"        │
│                                     │
│  ✅ You should do it because:       │
│     • Only you can decide          │
│     • Requires your relationships  │
│     • High-stakes negotiation      │
│     • Vision/strategy work         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

## Visual Kanban Columns (Whimsical Board)

### Column 1: INCOMING 📥
All tasks land here first. No judgment, just capture.

### Column 2: TRIAGE 🎯
Drag here to decide. Ask:
- **Do**: Only Brammo can do this (vision, deals, relationships)
- **Delegate**: Someone else can/should do this
- **Delete**: Doesn't actually need to happen
- **Defer**: Not now (move to backlog)

### Column 3: DO (Brammo Only) 🏍️
- Strategic decisions
- Key relationships
- High-stakes negotiations
- Vision work
- Deal structure

**Time limit**: 3-4 hours/day max

### Column 4: DELEGATE 🤝
**Sub-columns by person/role:**
- HDPM Team
- Contractors
- Brammolt (me)
- Partner/Advisor

**Required for each card:**
- Who gets it
- What success looks like
- When you need it back
- Level of involvement (review only / check-in / hands-off)

### Column 5: WAITING ⏳
Delegated tasks you're tracking. Check weekly, not daily.

### Column 6: DONE ✅
Archive weekly. Review what got done that you shouldn't have touched.

## Color Coding System
- 🔴 **Red**: Brammo Trap (you're doing but shouldn't)
- 🟢 **Green**: Properly delegated
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Needs decision (still in Triage too long)
- 🔵 **Blue**: Deep work (requires focus time)
- ⚪ **White**: Admin/routine

---

## Weekly Review Questions
1. What did I do this week that someone else should have?
2. What got delegated successfully?
3. What am I still holding that needs to move?
4. Where did I fall into the Brammo Trap?
