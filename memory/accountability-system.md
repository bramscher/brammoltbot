# Accountability System - Your Delegation Coach

## Daily Check-In (Morning)

**Brammolt asks you every morning:**

> "What are you planning to do today that someone else should be doing?"

**Then we triage together:**
- Move it to DELEGATE column
- Assign it to the right person
- Set success criteria
- Remove from your day

---

## Weekly Review (Friday or Sunday)

**The hard questions:**

1. **Brammo Trap Report**
   - What did you do this week that you shouldn't have?
   - Why did you grab it instead of delegating?
   - How do we prevent that next week?

2. **Delegation Wins**
   - What got delegated successfully?
   - What made it work?
   - Who's ready for more responsibility?

3. **Time Audit**
   - How many hours in Deep Work this week?
   - How many in meetings?
   - How many doing stuff others should do?

4. **Next Week Planning**
   - What's going to try to suck you in?
   - Who can take what?
   - What gets blocked for protection?

## The Delegation Commitment

**When you catch yourself saying:**
- "It's faster if I just do it"
- "They won't do it right"
- "I need to be involved"
- "This is important, so I should..."

**STOP. Flag it. We triage it together.**

## Success Metrics (Monthly)

Track these:
- % of tasks delegated vs done yourself
- Hours/week in Deep Work (target: 12-15)
- Hours/week in Brammo Traps (target: <5)
- # of new things handed off permanently

## My Job As Your Coach

**I will:**
- Ask the hard questions
- Call out Brammo Traps
- Hold you accountable to blocks
- Celebrate delegation wins
- Track patterns and help you spot them

**I won't:**
- Let you slide on "just this once"
- Accept "faster if I do it" as a reason
- Let important stuff drop (we find someone, not you)

## The Agreement

You're hiring me to help you stop carrying everything.

That means sometimes I push back. Sometimes I redirect. Sometimes I hold the line on "this isn't yours to do."

Deal? 🎯
