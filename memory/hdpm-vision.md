# High Desert PM — Strategic Vision

## The Goal
Build HDPM to 1,500 doors with option to sell to larger aggregator.

## Current State
- **Doors:** 830
- **Staff:** 7
- **Current efficiency:** 118 doors/person (already beating industry 50-100)
- **Adding:** 225 doors (Bend portfolio acquisition, comes with 3 employees)
- **Post-Bend:** 1,055 doors, 10 people, 105 doors/person
- **Outsourced maintenance:** $1.8M/year

## AI Stack (Deployed)
- **Haven:** Reception, leasing, maintenance triage
- **Quo AI:** Phone transcripts
- **Konmashi (coming):** Marketing, vacancy filling

## Target State
- **Doors:** 1,500
- **Staff:** 10 people total
  - 3 doing billable property maintenance (new revenue source)
  - 7 on PM operations
- **Efficiency:** 150 doors per employee (industry: 50-100)
- **Maintenance capture:** $500K in year 1 (from $1.8M outsourced)

## The AI Play
Deploy AI throughout operations to enable 10-person team managing 1,500 doors:
- Tenant communications (chatbots, auto-responses)
- Marketing for vacancies (Konmashi integration)
- Maintenance scheduling/dispatch
- Owner reporting
- Lease renewals
- Rent collection follow-up

Konmashi is the proving ground — build here, sell to Appfolio's 70K customers.

## Revenue Diversification
1. **Management fees** — core PM revenue
2. **Billable maintenance** — 3 in-house techs doing paid work
3. **Captured maintenance** — $500K yr 1 pulled from $1.8M outsourced
4. **Bend Radiant synergy** — plumbing goes to the sister company (50% owned)

## Exit Thesis
Sell to PE aggregator or larger PM company at premium multiple because:
- Scale: 1,500 doors is meaningful
- Efficiency: 150 doors/employee vs 50-100 industry standard
- Proprietary AI ops: Hard to replicate, Konmashi-powered
- Diversified revenue: Not just fees
- Vertical integration: Maintenance captured in-house + Bend Radiant

## Growth Engine
**Current:** Multiple leads per week (before marketing push)

| Channel | Status | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Owner outreach | Launching | Direct acquisition of doors |
| SEO | Launching | Inbound lead flow |
| YouTube | Launching | Authority, trust, inbound |
| Konmashi | Coming | Automate all of the above |
| Acquisitions | Opportunistic | Bolt-on portfolios |

YouTube + SEO = compounding lead flow that pays forever.
Konmashi turns one piece of content into multi-channel distribution.
