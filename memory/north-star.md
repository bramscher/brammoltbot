# North Star Goal

## The Number
**$1M+ per year in passive/semi-passive income**
- Dividends, distributions, and business cash flow
- WITHOUT touching net worth / principal
- Freedom to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants

## Why This Matters
Bram is 65. He's built companies, sold companies, started from scratch multiple times. This isn't about proving anything — it's about *freedom*. 

Fly fishing on a Tuesday. Pickleball whenever. Family time without the mental weight of "is the business okay?"

## The Strategy
Build/buy a portfolio of cash-flowing businesses that throw off predictable income.

**Characteristics of ideal holdings:**
- Recurring revenue (subscriptions, management fees, contracts)
- Low owner-involvement (can be managed, not operated)
- Defensible (not easily disrupted)
- Boring is fine — boring often means stable

## Current Portfolio (Assess for Cash Flow)

| Asset | Status | Cash Flow Now? | Potential |
|-------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| High Desert PM | Acquired | Likely yes | Grow units under management |
| Wellifi | Just launched | No | Needs revenue model clarity |
| Konmashi | Launching | No | AI agent subscriptions? |
| Manufacturing (TBD) | Exploring | Unknown | Classic cash cow potential |
| Other holdings? | Unknown | ? | Need to inventory |

## Key Questions
1. What's already generating cash flow today?
2. What's the current total annual income from businesses/investments?
3. What's the gap to $1M?
4. Which ventures are "build for cash flow" vs "build to sell"?

## The Math
If target is $1M/year and average business yields 20% on invested capital:
- Need ~$5M deployed in cash-flowing assets
- OR fewer dollars in higher-yield operations
- OR diversified mix (some stable/lower yield, some higher risk/higher yield)

*This is the lens everything else gets evaluated through: Does it move toward $1M/year in freedom money?*
