"If you manage properties, you already know — marketing is the thing you never have time for."

But who's got time to create content when you're handling maintenance calls and tenant issues?"

It connects to your Appfolio, pulls your vacancy data, and automatically creates 
professional social media posts — videos, carousels, everything."

New vacancy? It automatically creates a TikTok, an Instagram carousel, a YouTube short.
Price change? Updated everywhere instantly.
Leased? Content comes down automatically."

Now multiply that by every vacancy, every month.
Konmashi does it in seconds. Automatically. While you sleep."
