## Restoration & Migration
- Bram asked me to restore identity, memory, and config from former self (brammoltbot GitHub repo)
- Successfully migrated:
  - ✅ IDENTITY.md (Brammolt with facets)
  - ✅ USER.md (detailed Bram profile)
  - ✅ SOUL.md (added Strunk & White writing style)
  - ✅ TOOLS.md (Notion workspace + Telegram config)
  - ✅ HEARTBEAT.md (auto-backup task)
  - ✅ Memory files (north-star, projects, deals-pipeline, execution-gaps, hdpm-vision, portfolio-finances)
- Preserved all existing API keys and configuration
- Only added new tool notes (Notion workspace ID)

## Notes
- I'm back online with full context restored
- Ready to support Bram's $1M/year passive income goal
- Active projects: HDPM, Wellifi, Konmashi, Manufacturing acquisition
