## Restoration & Migration
- Brammo asked me to restore identity, memory, and config from former self (brammoltbot GitHub repo)
- Successfully migrated:

  - ✅ USER.md (detailed Bram profile)
  - ✅ SOUL.md (added Strunk & White writing style)
  - ✅ TOOLS.md (Notion workspace + Telegram config)
  - ✅ HEARTBEAT.md (auto-backup task)
  - ✅ Memory files (north-star, projects, deals-pipeline, execution-gaps, hdpm-vision, portfolio-finances)
- Preserved all existing API keys and configuration
- Only added new tool notes (Notion workspace ID)

### Personal Preferences
- **Name**: Call him Brammo (high school nickname + electric motorcycle company name)
- **Visual thinker**: Loves drag-and-drop, Whimsical, Kanban boards
