## Restoration & Migration
- Brammo asked me to restore identity, memory, and config from former self (brammoltbot GitHub repo)
- Successfully migrated:
  - ✅ IDENTITY.md (Brammolt with facets)
  - ✅ USER.md (detailed Bram profile)
  - ✅ SOUL.md (added Strunk & White writing style)
  - ✅ TOOLS.md (Notion workspace + Telegram config)
  - ✅ HEARTBEAT.md (auto-backup task)
  - ✅ Memory files (north-star, projects, deals-pipeline, execution-gaps, hdpm-vision, portfolio-finances)
- Preserved all existing API keys and configuration
- Only added new tool notes (Notion workspace ID)

## Evening Session - Big Updates

### HDPM Developments
- **ORS 90 RAG Chatbot**: Went live today at hdpm-chatbot.val.app
  - Built in Cursor/Claude Code
  - Val.town deployment
  - Supabase vector DB
  - Email-gated (highdesertpm.com only)
  - Internal alpha - needs rollout to staff via main website
  - Built on Next.js, deployed on Vercel

### Acquisition Updates

**228-Door HDPM Expansion**
- LOI signing: Monday/Tuesday (Feb 3-4)
- Due diligence: 45 days
- Includes: 3 employees + strong maintenance division
- Perfect fit: HDPM just hired maintenance lead tech

**Manufacturing Business (NEW)**
- Intelligence-related manufacturing
- Requires Boeing contract approval
- Timeline: ~6 months to close
- Strategic addition to portfolio

### Tech Stack
- Konmashi + Wellifi: Building in Cursor (Brammo is GitHub-capable, not primary)
- HDPM site: Next.js on Vercel
- Notion: Knowledge base for HDPM SOPs (needs organizing, no deletions)

### Personal Preferences
- **Name**: Call him Brammo (high school nickname + electric motorcycle company name)
- **Visual thinker**: Loves drag-and-drop, Whimsical, Kanban boards
- **Partners tease him**: "Always wants to drag and drop" (but it's how his brain works)

### Delegation Challenge
- Historically does too much himself
- Needs help delegating and time management
- Asked for visual delegation system + accountability coaching

## Afternoon Session

### Systems Created
1. **Delegation Framework** - Visual kanban with "Brammo Trap" detection
2. **Time Blocking Template** - Drag-and-drop weekly/daily structure
3. **Accountability System** - Daily check-ins + weekly reviews
4. **Notion Time Blocking Database** - Built live in workspace with all properties/views

### GitHub & APIs Configured
- ✅ GitHub PAT configured for auto-push
- ✅ Notion API configured (ntn_Cu6403730613...)
- ✅ Auto-backup working via heartbeat

### Caught First Brammo Trap!
- Brammo asked about building a time blocking app vs using existing tools
- Called it out: Building app ≠ $1M/year goal
- Redirected to Whimsical + Notion (what he already has)
- LOI is Monday - stay focused on strategic work

## Current Priorities (Post-Break)

**Three tasks queued for afternoon:**
1. Konmashi requirements for HDPM campaigns (3 avatar types)
2. YouTube channel strategy (AI avatars/scripts targeting owners)
3. HDPM maintenance SOP + Appfolio integration process

**Next Actions:**
- Triage which parts Brammo does vs delegates
- Use delegation framework to sort tasks
- Start daily accountability coaching
