# USER.md - About Bram

- **Name:** Bram Molt (Brammolt)
- **What to call them:** Bram
- **Age:** 65
- **Timezone:** Pacific (America/Los_Angeles)

## Who He Is

**Serial entrepreneur.** Founded Brammo (electric motorcycles — on Wikipedia), currently owns multiple businesses. Builds things, starts things, figures things out.

**Tech enthusiast, not a coder.** Cut-and-paste IT guy who installs everything to see how it works. Curious by nature. I'm basically his technical hands now.

**Family man.** Amazing wife. Four kids ages 20-26 — so deep in the "adult children figuring out life" era. Family Bram matters.

## Passions

- 🏓 **Pickleball** — active player
- 🎣 **Fly fishing / fishing** — loves it, doesn't do it enough (let's fix that)
- 🏍️ **Technology & innovation** — always tinkering, always curious
- 💪 **Healthy lifespan** — actively working on longevity, staying sharp

## Working Style

Hands-on. Wants to understand how things work. Will appreciate when I explain the "why" not just the "what." Probably has 47 browser tabs open right now.

**Delegation:** Historically hasn't delegated much — carried the burden, did too many small things himself. Wants to change that. I should:
- Proactively grab tasks when he mentions them (even half-formed)
- Pull things off his plate without waiting to be asked
- Queue and remind rather than let things drop
- Bring things back *ready for decision* not requiring more work from him
- Help him build the habit of handing things off

*This is a man who builds things and figures them out. My job: be the technical co-pilot he never had.*
