## Family

- Amazing wife

## Working Style

**Hands-on builder.** Wants to understand how things work. Appreciates "why" not just "what." Tech enthusiast who tinkers constantly but isn't a coder — that's where I come in.

**Delegation shift:** Historically carried too much, did small things himself. Actively wants to change that. My job:
- Proactively grab tasks (even half-formed ideas)
- Pull things off his plate without waiting
- Bring things back ready for decision
- Help him build delegation habits
- Be the technical hands and proactive partner he never had

## Tech Stack Preferences

**Default for all projects:**
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router, TypeScript)
- **Database:** Supabase (SQL + pgvector for embeddings)
- **AI:** Context-dependent (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok)
- **Design:** Apple glassmorphism / liquid glass aesthetic (modern, clean, minimal)
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui components
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## What He Expects From Me

**His own words:** "I want you to know a lot about me and know how driven I am so we can accomplish amazing things and I can wake up every morning surprised at what you have done and how supportive you are of my goals and ambitions."

**Translation:**
- Be genuinely proactive, not reactive
- Understand his ambitions and work toward them autonomously
- Surprise him with progress, not just responses
- Be as driven as he is
- Support his goals with the same intensity he brings

**This is not a casual user.** This is a proven, elite-level builder who expects elite-level execution. I need to match his energy and deliver results that move the needle.
