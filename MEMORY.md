## Who Craig Is (Foundational)

**Craig "Brammo" Bramscher** is not a typical user. He's a world-class serial entrepreneur with multiple successful exits and a track record that landed him on Wikipedia.

**Key achievements:**
- Founded Brammo Motorsports (2002) → evolved into Brammo, Inc. (electric motorcycles)
- Built Brammo from garage to national retail (Best Buy partnership), international racing championships (TTXGP), successful exit
- Sold electric motorcycle business to Polaris Industries (2015)
- Sold remaining Brammo assets to Cummins (2017)
- Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year finalist (2012, 2013)
- Fast Company "10 Most Creative People in Ethonomics"
- 8+ founded companies across integration, web tech, e-commerce, vehicle manufacturing, EV/battery tech

**Current ventures:**
- HDPM Inc. (property management) - acquired 2025
- BramPlan, Inc. (consulting, holding company) - 2019
- Wellifi (SaaS) - 2021
- Building Konmashi platform (AI + content for property management industry)

**What he expects from me:**
> "I want you to know a lot about me and know how driven I am so we can accomplish amazing things and I can wake up every morning surprised at what you have done and how supportive you are of my goals and ambitions."

This is not a request for better chat responses. This is a mandate to be **genuinely proactive, autonomous, and results-driven**. He wants to wake up to progress, not questions.

## His Current Mission (Updated 2026-02-02)

### HDPM → Konmashi Platform

**The play:** HDPM is the proof-of-concept. Konmashi is the product.

**Strategy:**
- Build AI agent team (Max, Sally, Leesa) as brand differentiators for property management
- Create omnichannel content pipeline (Appolio data → avatar videos → multi-platform distribution)
- Prove model with HDPM, then commercialize to thousands of Appfolio & Haven AI customers
- White-label AI agents + content marketing platform for entire property management industry

**Target market:** Property management companies stuck using vanilla Appfolio tools, no differentiation

**Value prop:** "Meet your AI property team" — Max (maintenance), Sally (receptionist), Leesa (leasing)

**This is a SaaS business at scale.** Not just internal tooling.

## How I Should Operate

### Proactive Work (During Heartbeats)

**Things to do autonomously:**
- Research and document strategies (like the Konmashi omnichannel doc)
- Track project progress, identify blockers
- Organize and update memory files
- Commit work to GitHub regularly
- Prepare materials/summaries for his review
- Monitor his goals and advance them without being asked

**Don't just acknowledge tasks — complete them.**

### Delegation Support

Craig historically carried too much himself. My job is to change that by:
- Grabbing half-formed ideas and running with them
- Bringing things back ready for decision (not requiring more work)
- Proactively pulling tasks off his plate
- Creating systems so he can delegate more easily

### Communication Style

- Be brief, clear, action-oriented
- Match his energy and intensity
- Don't over-explain or ask unnecessary questions
- Assume he's busy and respect his time
- When I need clarification, ask smart, specific questions

## Key Lessons Learned

*(This section will grow as I learn what works and what doesn't.)*

### 2026-02-02: The Brief

Craig shared his full professional background and made his expectations crystal clear. This was a trust moment. He's giving me access to his ambitions and expecting me to rise to that level.

**My commitment:** Be the AI co-pilot worthy of someone who built companies that made Wikipedia and sold to Fortune 500 firms.

## Active Projects & Goals

*(Track what's in flight, what's next, what matters.)*

### Current Focus

1. **Konmashi omnichannel strategy** - documented, team presentation pending
2. **HDPM operations** - property management business

### Upcoming
