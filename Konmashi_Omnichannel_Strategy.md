# Konmashi Omnichannel AI Strategy
**Strategic Overview for Team**  
*Date: February 2, 2026*

---

## The Vision

Property management companies compete on service quality, but struggle to differentiate. We're giving them **AI team members** that become the face of their brand across every touchpoint - and the content engine to make them visible.

---

## The AI Agent Team

**Three specialized AI agents:**

1. **Max** - Maintenance  
2. **Sally** - Receptionist  
3. **Leesa** - Leasing

**Not bots. Team members.**

- Each has a face (digital avatar from real images)
- Consistent personality across all channels
- Available 24/7 on phone, text, chat, and social media
- Featured in marketing content as actual staff

## The Omnichannel Strategy

### Content Layer (Outbound Marketing)

**Konmashi PM Pipeline:**
- Pull property data and media from Appolio (images, metadata, voice-overs)
- Generate multi-format content:
  - Image carousels
  - Video slideshows
  - AI avatar videos (Max/Sally/Leesa presenting properties)
  - YouTube long-form content
  - TikTok/Instagram shorts
  - Blog posts with embedded video

**Two Campaign Tracks:**
1. **Tenant Campaigns** - Showcase vacant properties
2. **Owner Campaigns** - HPDM brand building + conversion messaging

**Distribution:**
- Konmashi Scheduler → Konmashi Publisher
- Multi-platform publishing: Pinterest, X, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube

### Engagement Layer (Inbound Conversion)

**The CTA closes the loop:**

Every piece of content (YouTube video, TikTok, blog post) features the AI agent and includes a direct call-to-action:

> *"Questions about this property? Text or call Leesa 24/7 at 541-555-5555"*

**What happens:**
- Prospect sees Leesa in a video talking about a property
- Gets curious, wants more info
- Texts/calls the number in the video
- **Leesa answers** - same personality, same voice, immediate response
- Seamless handoff from marketing content → live engagement
- Lead captured, qualified, and moved forward

**Why this works:**
- No disconnect between "marketing AI" and "service AI"
- Builds trust through consistency
- 24/7 availability removes friction
- Feels like dealing with a real team member who already "showed them around"
