## What's Inside

### Portfolio Projects Database
📊 Track all projects across your 7 businesses

**Features:**
- ✅ **Visual status** (🟢 Active, 🟡 Waiting on Brammo, 🔴 Blocked, ✅ Done)
- ✅ **Business tags** (HDPM, KD Manufacturing, Bend Radiant, Hangten Studio, Wellifi, Konmashi x2, Bolt-On Acquisition)
- ✅ **Priority levels** (High, Medium, Low)
- ✅ **"Needs From Brammo"** column - see what's waiting on you at a glance
- ✅ **Next Action** - what moves it forward
- ✅ **Due dates** - optional deadlines
- ✅ **Notes** - context and details
- ✅ **Drag-and-drop** between statuses

## Current Projects Loaded

1. **HDPM Chatbot** (✅ Done) - deployed and working
2. **Konmashi Omnichannel Strategy** (🟡 Waiting on Brammo) - needs team presentation scheduled
3. **Max/Sally/Leesa Personas** (🟡 Waiting on Brammo) - decision: now or after validation?

## How I'll Use This

**Autonomous updates:**
- I'll add new projects as they come up
- Update status based on our conversations
- Flag things that haven't moved in 48 hours
- Surface blockers before you ask

**You bounce between projects:**
- Open dashboard → see what needs you
- Drag cards to update status
- Drop in, decide, move on
- Trust nothing falls through the cracks

## Views You Can Create

Notion lets you create multiple views of the same database:

1. **Board View** - Kanban by Status (drag cards between columns)
2. **Table View** - Spreadsheet (sort/filter/group)
3. **Gallery View** - Visual cards
4. **Calendar View** - By due date
5. **Timeline View** - Gantt chart

**Recommended:** Create a Board view grouped by Status - perfect for your drag-and-drop workflow.
